There are blue arrows on the ground that would denote where cars would drive, and there are red arrows on the ground to show where pedestrians can walk, based on the walk signals and stoplights, and what it all shows.
Our intention with this project was to have a secure system to represent an intersection where no cars can get into a crash and no pedestrians get hit, assuming nobody goes when they're told not to.
